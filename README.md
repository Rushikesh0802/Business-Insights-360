In this project, Atliq Hardware is an imaginary company that is a leading computer manufacturer worldwide.
They sell products to various regions but face significant losses in Latin America. 
I have created a meaningful dashboard for Atliq Hardware and analyzed the company's performance


Project Details
Department wise reports

Finance:
Shows how the company is doing financially, including profits, costs, and budget tracking, to help manage money effectively.

Sales:
Tracks how well products are selling, how many deals are being closed, and helps the sales team hit their targets.

Marketing:
Measures how well marketing campaigns are working, how many people are engaging, and helps improve customer attraction and brand growth.

Supply Chain:
Manages inventory, orders, and deliveries to make sure products are available and reach customers on time

Situation:
Atliq Hardware was facing a challenge with declining sales in certain regions. They were struggling to understand why their sales were underperforming in specific areas and needed a solution to analyze their sales data more effectively

Task:
My goal was to help Atliq Hardware by providing a comprehensive solution to analyze sales data, identify the regions with underperforming sales, and gain insights across multiple areas of their business

Action:
To address these challenges, I created a Power BI dashboard that displayed sales data in an easy-to-understand, real-time format. I focused on building key views to provide detailed insights into different aspects of the business

âœ… Finance View: Gave a clear overview of financial performance, including revenue, costs, and profitability, helping the company make better financial decisions.
âœ… Sales View: Highlighted sales trends, product performance, and regional analysis to pinpoint areas where sales were underperforming.
âœ… Marketing View: Tracked marketing campaigns and customer engagement, providing insights into the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.
âœ… Supply Chain View: Focused on inventory and order fulfillment data, helping improve supply chain management and efficiency.
âœ… Executive View: Offered a high-level summary of key performance indicators, allowing executives to track the company's overall performance and growth

For this project, I utilized:
ðŸ”§ Power BI to create interactive, easy-to-read reports
ðŸ”§ DAX Studio to optimize and speed up data processing
ðŸ”§ Excel Sheets to organize and clean the data

Result:
Atliq Hardware now has a comprehensive, real-time view of their sales, marketing, financial, and supply chain performance. This solution has empowered them to make data-driven decisions, optimize sales strategies, and improve business operations.
Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and helping businesses unlock the full potential of their data
